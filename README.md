## Problem Statement
Fraud detection in digital transactions is often reactive and struggles with high false positives and latency, making it difficult to ensure real-time user protection.

## Objective
To build a scalable, secure, and real-time fraud detection system leveraging Azure cloud services, ensuring quick response and accurate identification of fraudulent behavior.

---

## Challenges
- **High False Positives**: Legitimate users flagged incorrectly.
- **Latency Issues**: Delays in fraud detection can cause financial loss.
- **Scalability**: Increasing transaction volumes demand scalable solutions.
- **Security**: Ensuring privacy and safe handling of user data.

---

## Proposed Solution
Develop a cloud-native fraud detection system using Microsoft Azure services that integrates machine learning, scalable storage, and secure APIs.

---

## Tech Stack (Azure Services)
- **Azure App Service** → Hosting backend APIs for fraud detection.
- **Azure Functions** → Event-driven microservices for real-time triggers.
- **Azure Cosmos DB** → High-performance, globally distributed database for user and transaction data.
- **Azure Machine Learning** → Train, deploy, and manage fraud detection ML models.
- **Azure Active Directory (AAD)** → Secure authentication and role-based access.

---

## Architecture Flow
1. **User Transaction** → Enters the system through API (hosted on Azure App Service).
2. **Event Trigger** → Azure Functions process transaction events.
3. **Data Storage** → Transaction data stored in Azure Cosmos DB.
4. **Fraud Detection** → Azure ML model evaluates risk score.
5. **Decision** → Response sent back via API (flag as fraud/safe).
6. **Security** → Authentication handled by Azure Active Directory.

---

---

## Impact
- **Faster Detection** → Real-time fraud alerts.
- **Higher Accuracy** → Reduced false positives using ML.
- **Scalable** → Azure handles increasing user demand.
- **Secure** → Enterprise-grade security with AAD.
